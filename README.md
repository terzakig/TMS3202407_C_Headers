# C Header files for the TMS3202407 DSP Controller (EzDSP2407) 

This repository contains a set of C header files including all core and peripheral register in the TM320LF2407 DSP controller by Texas Instruments. This controller is tranditionally programmed in Assembly primarily to exploit its special instruction set for performing standard DSP operations such as convolution. However, there is no reason to initialize the peripherals in Assembly as this can be easily done with C.

The header files were developed and used in the examples of my book [**Introduction to C Programming with the TMS32LF2407 DSP Controller**](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-TMS320LF2407ATM-DSP-Controller/dp/145658880X). The examples can be found [here](https://github.com/terzakig/TMS320LF2407_Examples).
